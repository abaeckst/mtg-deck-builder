# Phase 4A Session 1 - Multi-Word Search Fix - Completion

**Date:** June 5, 2025  
**Session Goal:** Fix multi-word search functionality  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  

## Implementation Summary

Fixed the `buildEnhancedSearchQuery` function in `src/services/scryfallApi.ts` to properly handle multi-word searches.

### Changes Made

**File Modified:** `src/services/scryfallApi.ts`

**Problem:** Multi-word searches like "lightning bolt" generated restrictive query: `o:lightning o:bolt`

**Solution:** Changed to comprehensive field search: `(name:lightning OR o:lightning OR type:lightning) (name:bolt OR o:bolt OR type:bolt)`

### Verification Results

✅ "lightning bolt" now finds Lightning Bolt card  
✅ "flying creature" finds creatures with flying ability  
✅ `"exact phrase"` still works for exact matches  
✅ Single word searches work across name/text/type  

## Current Status After Session

Multi-word search system now works as expected. Phase 4A-2 (Progressive Loading) ready for implementation.
