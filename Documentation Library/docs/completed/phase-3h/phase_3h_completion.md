## üö® User Issues Discovered Post-Completion

**Note:** After achieving Phase 3H completion, comprehensive user testing revealed specific workflow issues that require priority attention before proceeding with original enhancement roadmap.

### **Critical Issues Identified (June 5, 2025)**
1. **Search pagination limitation** - Only first 175 results processed
2. **Multi-word search issues** - Natural language search not working without quotes
3. **Filter panel appearance** - Professional styling needs improvement
4. **Missing subtype filters** - No way to filter by creature types, etc.
5. **Card resolution at small sizes** - Poor readability when scaled down
6. **Missing large card preview** - No way to examine card details
7. **Right-click selection** - Context menu doesn't select clicked card
8. **Drag experience** - Preview positioning and zone feedback issues
9. **Screenshot robustness** - Generation system needs reliability improvements

### **Issue Resolution Planning**
**Decision:** Prioritize user issue resolution (Phase 4A-4E) before original enhancement roadmap
