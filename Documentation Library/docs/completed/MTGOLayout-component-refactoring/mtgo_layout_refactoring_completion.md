### Integration Patterns Established
```typescript
// Coordinator Pattern (MTGOLayout.tsx)
<CollectionArea 
  cards={searchResults.data}
  onLoadMore={loadMore}
  // ... other coordinated props
/>

// Area-Specific Pattern (CollectionArea.tsx)
const CollectionArea = ({ cards, onLoadMore, ... }) => {
  // Area-specific rendering and interaction logic
  return (
    <div className="collection-area">
      {/* Area-specific UI */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Lessons Learned & Patterns Established

### Component Extraction Methodology ✅
**When to Apply Component Extraction:**
- **Size Threshold:** Components exceeding 800-900 lines with multiple major responsibilities
- **Complexity Indicators:** Mixed concerns, difficult maintenance, too many integration points
- **Success Example:** MTGOLayout.tsx (925 lines → 450 line coordinator + 3 focused components)

**Component Extraction Process:**
1. **Identify Distinct Areas:** Collection, deck, sideboard responsibilities clearly separable
2. **Create Focused Components:** Each component handles one cohesive area of functionality  
3. **Maintain Coordinator:** Preserve external API compatibility and hook integration
4. **Implement Clean Interfaces:** Props-based communication between coordinator and areas
5. **Apply Smart Testing:** Validate zero regressions during extraction

### Architecture Coordination Patterns ✅
```typescript
// Coordinator Pattern for Hook Integration
const MTGOLayout = () => {
  const cards = useCards();
  const selection = useSelection();
  const dragDrop = useDragAndDrop();
  
  return (
    <>
      <CollectionArea cards={cards} selection={selection} dragDrop={dragDrop} />
      <DeckArea cards={cards} selection={selection} dragDrop={dragDrop} />
      <SideboardArea cards={cards} selection={selection} dragDrop={dragDrop} />
    </>
  );
};

// Area Component Pattern for Focused Functionality
const CollectionArea = ({ cards, selection, dragDrop }) => {
  // Area-specific rendering logic only
  // All state management through props from coordinator
};
```

### External API Preservation ✅
**Critical Success Factor:**
- **Principle:** Other components should not need changes during component refactoring
- **Implementation:** Coordinator maintains exact same external interface for App.tsx
- **Benefit:** Enables large-scale refactoring without affecting external integrations
