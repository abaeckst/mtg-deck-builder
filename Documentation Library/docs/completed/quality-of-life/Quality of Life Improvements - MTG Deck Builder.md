# Quality of Life Improvements - MTG Deck Builder

**Date Created:** June 2, 2025 
**Status:** Planned - Ready for Implementation 
**Source:** Real user feedback from production usage testing 
**Priority:** Critical deck building rule violations and UX issues 

## üéØ Overview

Following Phase 3H completion, real-world usage testing revealed several critical issues that affect core deck building functionality and user experience. These improvements address rule violations, selection behavior problems, and visual issues that impact daily usage.

## üìã Issue Discovery Source

**User Feedback Context:**

- Real user testing with completed application
- Facebook Messenger chat log analysis
- Screenshot analysis showing visual issues
- Identification of Magic rule violations in current implementation
  **Key User:** Matthew (experienced MTG player)
- Provided detailed feedback on search, view modes, and feature requests
- Identified critical deck building rule violations
- Suggested specific enhancements based on Arena familiarity
  
  ## üö® Critical Issues Identified
  
  ### **Rule Violations (Highest Priority)**
1. **Incorrect 4-Copy Limit Enforcement**
   - **Issue:** App enforces 4-copy limit per zone (deck OR sideboard) instead of total
   - **Expected:** Maximum 4 copies combined across maindeck + sideboard
   - **Impact:** Users can build illegal decks unknowingly
   - **Fix Required:** Modify quantity tracking to enforce total copies across zones
2. **Basic Land Exception Missing**
   - **Issue:** Basic lands subject to 4-copy limit
   - **Expected:** Basic lands should have unlimited copies
   - **Impact:** Users cannot build proper mana bases
   - **Fix Required:** Add basic land detection and exemption logic
     
     ### **Selection System Issues**
3. **Over-Selection Behavior**
   - **Issue:** Selecting one card selects ALL copies across all zones
   - **Expected:** Individual card selection only
   - **Impact:** Users cannot perform targeted actions on specific cards
   - **Fix Required:** Modify selection logic to target individual cards
     
     ### **Visual Issues**
4. **Unwanted Colored Borders**
   - **Issue:** Cards display colored borders when they shouldn't
   - **Expected:** Only selected cards should have visual indicators
   - **Impact:** Visual confusion and unprofessional appearance
   - **Fix Required:** Review and clean up card border CSS logic
