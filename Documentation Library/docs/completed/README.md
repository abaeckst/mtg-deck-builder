# Implementation Case Studies

Detailed case studies of completed major features and architectural work.

## Current Case Studies Available:
- **Phase 1-4B Development** - Complete deck builder implementation journey
- **Performance Optimization** - Search, Load More, and image loading improvements
- **Architecture Overhaul** - useCards coordination hub and hook extraction
- **Component Extraction** - MTGOLayout refactoring methodology and results
- **UI/UX Enhancement** - Unified state implementation and responsive design

## When to Archive New Case Studies:
- Major feature implementations with complex technical details
- Architectural decisions with significant trade-offs and context
- Implementation approaches that solved difficult integration challenges
- Performance work with measurable before/after improvements

## Retrieval:
Request when implementing similar features - "How did we build X feature?"
