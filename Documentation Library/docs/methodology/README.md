# Methodology Patterns

Reusable development patterns and systematic approaches for complex challenges.

## Current Proven Methodologies:
- **Component Extraction** - Proven with MTGOLayout (925→450 lines) + 3 focused components
- **Performance Optimization** - Search optimization (<1 second), Load More fixes, image loading
- **Hook Architecture** - useCards coordinator (580→250 lines) + 5 extracted hooks
- **Unified State Management** - Complex state coordination with automatic migration
- **Advanced Debugging** - Systematic React/TypeScript problem resolution approaches

## When to Archive New Methodologies:
- Multi-session complex problems that were solved systematically
- Approaches that could be reapplied to similar future problems
- Technical implementations with non-obvious solutions
- Debugging patterns that worked well for complex integration issues

## Retrieval:
Request when facing similar problems to past solutions - "How did we solve X?"
