# Phase Implementation Guide - Issue-Driven Development Roadmap

**Purpose:** Technical implementation details for addressing identified user issues 
**Current Status:** Phase 3H Complete - Core application ready for enhancement 
**Focus:** User-reported issues and experience improvements (Priority over original Phase 4+) 

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Phase 4A - Search System Overhaul

### Technical Requirements

**Goal:** Fix critical search limitations affecting user workflow 
**Timeline:** 3-4 sessions (6-8 hours) 
**Dependencies:** Phase 3H completion (âœ… DONE) 
**User Impact:** HIGH - Directly addresses workflow-breaking search issues 

### Core Issues to Resolve

1. **Pagination Limitation Crisis**
   - Current: Only shows first 175 results, then sorts locally
   - Problem: "Black cards in standard" sorted by cheapest CMC doesn't show actual cheapest
   - Solution: Complete pagination handling with progressive loading
2. **Multi-Word Search Failure**
   - Current: "a killer" without quotes doesn't find "A Killer Among Us"
   - Problem: Natural language search broken
   - Solution: Enhanced query construction for phrase matching
3. **Multi-Color Filter Confusion**
   - Current: Unclear behavior for color combinations
   - Problem: Users expect "at most these colors" but behavior unclear
   - Solution: Clear UI indicators and proper logic for color matching modes
     
     ### Implementation Architecture
     
     #### Enhanced API Service Structure
     
     ```typescript
     interface PaginatedSearchResult {
     cards: ScryfallCard[];
     totalCards: number;
     hasMore: boolean;
     nextPage?: string;
     searchId: string; // For tracking progressive searches
     }
     interface SearchProgress {
     searchId: string;
     totalFetched: number;
     totalAvailable: number;
     isComplete: boolean;
     currentPage: number;
     }
     interface ColorFilterMode {
     mode: 'at_most' | 'exactly' | 'at_least';
     includeColorless: boolean;
     multicolorOnly: boolean; // For "gold button" functionality
     }
     ```
     
     #### File Modification Plan
4. **`src/services/scryfallApi.ts`** (MAJOR UPDATES)
   - Add progressive pagination fetching
   - Implement smart query construction for multi-word searches
   - Add search progress tracking and cancellation
   - Implement proper rate limiting for large searches
5. **`src/hooks/useCards.ts`** (MAJOR UPDATES)
   - Handle paginated search results
   - Implement search progress state management
   - Add sorting across all results (not just first page)
   - Add color filter mode handling
6. **`src/components/SearchAutocomplete.tsx`** (MODERATE UPDATES)
   - Add search progress indicator
   - Add multi-word search mode indicators
   - Implement search cancellation UI
7. **Filter Components** (NEW/UPDATED)
   - Create color filter mode selector
   - Add "gold button" for multicolor-only filtering
   - Add clear visual indicators for filter behavior
     
     ### Success Criteria
- [ ] Search fetches ALL matching cards, regardless of quantity
- [ ] Multi-word search works naturally without requiring quotes
- [ ] Color filters have clear "at most" vs "exactly" indicators
- [ ] Gold button correctly shows only multi-colored cards
- [ ] Large searches show progress and can be cancelled

  ## ðŸŽ¯ HIGH PRIORITY: Phase 4B - Filter System Redesign
  
  ### Technical Requirements
  
  **Goal:** Professional MTGO-style filter interface with enhanced functionality 
  **Timeline:** 4-5 sessions (8-10 hours) 
  **Dependencies:** Phase 4A completion 
  **User Impact:** HIGH - Dramatically improves usability and professional appearance 
  
  ### Core Issues to Resolve
1. **Filter Panel Appearance**
   - Current: "Ugly" filter panel that doesn't match MTGO standard
   - Solution: Complete visual redesign with professional MTGO styling
2. **Filter Organization**
   - Current: All filters expanded, overwhelming interface
   - Expected: Only format/colors/type/rarity visible, others collapsed
   - Solution: Collapsible sections with smart defaults
3. **Missing Subtype Filters**
   - Current: No way to filter by creature types, spell types, etc.
   - Challenge: Hundreds of possible subtypes require smart UI
   - Solution: Autocomplete system with grouped/popular options
4. **Multi-Color Gold Button**
   - Current: No easy way to filter for gold/multicolor cards
   - Solution: Dedicated button integrated with color filters
     
     ### Implementation Architecture
     
     #### Professional Filter System
     
     ```typescript
     interface FilterPanelSection {
     id: string;
     title: string;
     defaultExpanded: boolean;
     component: React.ComponentType;
     priority: number; // Display order
     }
     interface SubtypeFilterState {
     selectedSubtypes: Set<string>;
     searchTerm: string;
     popularSubtypes: string[];
     groupedSubtypes: Map<string, string[]>; // Category -> subtypes
     }
     interface FilterTheme {
     mode: 'mtgo' | 'modern';
     colors: {
     background: string;
     border: string;
     text: string;

     visible: boolean;
     card: ScryfallCard | DeckCard | DeckCardInstance | null;
     position: { x: number; y: number };
     size: 'large' | 'extra_large';
     pinned: boolean; // For click-to-pin functionality
     }
     interface ImageQualitySettings {
     useHighResolution: boolean;
     preferredFormat: 'png' | 'jpg' | 'webp';
     scalingAlgorithm: 'crisp' | 'smooth' | 'auto';

     ### Implementation Architecture
     
     #### Enhanced Interaction System
     
     ```typescript
     interface DragPreviewSettings {
     offsetX: number; // Pixels from cursor
     offsetY: number; // Pixels from cursor
     showZoneFeedback: boolean; // Disable per user request
     showDropValidation: boolean; // Disable per user request
     }
     interface SelectionIntegration {
     rightClickSelects: boolean;
     maintainMultiSelection: boolean;
     clearOnModeSwitch: boolean;
     }
     ```
