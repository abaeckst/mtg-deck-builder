# Documentation Library - Strategic Archives

This directory contains strategic knowledge for complex MTG Deck Builder development challenges.

## Structure
- `/specs/` - System-level feature specifications (Search, Drag&Drop, Layout, etc.)
- `/methodology/` - Reusable development patterns and debugging approaches  
- `/completed/` - Implementation case studies with technical details
- `/sessions/` - Detailed development session archives (organized by date)
- `/reference/` - Reference materials and external documentation
- `/archive_planning/` - Archived planning documents (historical context)
- `/archive_platform/` - Archived platform documentation (historical context)

## Usage Pattern
- **Active development:** Use Code Organization Guide (in Claude's memory) primarily
- **System work:** Request relevant feature specifications from `/specs/`
- **Complex problems:** Request strategic archive retrieval for methodology replication
- **Historical context:** Reference archived materials when needed

## Maintenance
- **Active documents:** Maintained in Claude's memory, updated through reconciliation
- **Strategic archives:** Created on-demand based on development session recommendations
- **Historical archives:** Preserved for context but not actively maintained
