# Session Archives

Detailed development session logs with full technical context and decision history.

## Organization:
- Date-based folders: `YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Individual session logs within date folders
- Multi-session projects may have dedicated sub-folders

## Content Examples:
- Technical decisions and implementation rationale
- Debugging processes and breakthrough solutions
- Integration challenges and resolution approaches
- Performance work with timing analysis and measurements
- Architectural evolution with trade-off analysis

## Archival Process:
1. Session logs created as artifacts during development
2. During reconciliation, user processes valuable sessions
3. Archive sessions with complex problem resolution or methodology development
4. Most session value captured in methodology patterns and case studies

## Retrieval:
Rarely needed directly - most value extracted into methodology and case study archives.
