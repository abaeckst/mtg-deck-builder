## ðŸ“š Template Usage Guidelines

### **When Creating New Specs:**

- **Start comprehensive** - capture all relevant context while fresh in memory
- **Focus on intent** - document why decisions were made, not just what was implemented
- **Include examples** - specific behaviors, edge cases, interaction patterns
- **Note evolution** - how the system has changed and why
  
  ### **When Updating Existing Specs:**
- **Track changes** - document what evolved and rationale for changes
- **Preserve context** - maintain historical reasoning even when approaches change 
- **Update performance data** - keep benchmarks current with actual measurements
- **Validate accuracy** - ensure spec reflects current implementation reality
  
  ### **Information Priorities:**
  
  **Essential:** Core functionality, key architectural decisions, performance targets, critical user interactions 
  **Important:** Design rationale, integration patterns, responsive behavior, error handling 
  **Valuable:** Evolution context, alternatives considered, future considerations, detailed examples
  
  ### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- **Over-documenting implementation details** - focus on intent and behavior over code specifics
- **Under-documenting design decisions** - capture why, not just what
- **Ignoring user experience** - balance technical architecture with user-facing behavior
- **Static documentation** - specs should evolve with the system, not become outdated artifacts

**Template Status:** Ready for system-level feature specification creation 
**Next Steps:** Create spec index integrated with documentation catalog, begin systematic spec creation for major systems
