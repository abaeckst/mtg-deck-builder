## ü§ù Collaborative Planning Framework

### Session Startup: Client Vision First
```markdown
## Planning Session: [Date] - [Feature Area] - Collaborative Discovery

### Client Vision Discovery
**Primary Questions:**
- What does success look like for [feature area]?
- What frustrates you about current solutions in this space?
- What are your key constraints (timeline, resources, technical)?
- How do your users actually use [related functionality] today?
- What's your philosophy on [relevant technical/strategic tradeoffs]?

### Expert Knowledge Application
**After Understanding Client Vision:**
- Technical possibilities that align with client goals
- Industry best practices relevant to client priorities
- Tradeoff analysis based on client constraints
- Implementation strategies matching client resources
```

### Collaborative Discovery Process

#### Phase 1: Understand Client Needs (20-30 minutes)
**Approach:** Ask clarifying questions to understand:
- Business goals and success metrics
- User experience philosophy and priorities
- Technical constraints and preferences  
- Timeline and resource reality
- Current pain points with existing solutions

**Expert Role:** Listen, ask follow-up questions, identify implications

#### Phase 2: Expert Context & Options (15-20 minutes)  
**Approach:** Based on client input, provide:
- Relevant technical possibilities
- Industry examples that match client vision
- Tradeoff analysis for different approaches
- Resource/timeline implications of various options

**Expert Role:** Educate on possibilities, highlight tradeoffs, suggest approaches

#### Phase 3: Collaborative Solution Design (30-45 minutes)
**Approach:** Work together to:
- Align technical approaches with client vision
- Make strategic decisions based on constraints
- Define scope and implementation priorities
- Create specifications ready for development

**Expert Role:** Guide technical decisions, validate feasibility, document approach

### Adaptive Scope Based on Discovery

#### Quick Strategy Session (60 minutes total)
**When:** Clear vision, straightforward implementation
**Focus:** Rapid alignment on approach and high-level specifications
**Output:** Strategic direction with implementation framework

#### Deep Specification Session (90-120 minutes)
**When:** Complex decisions, multiple technical options, detailed planning needed
**Focus:** Comprehensive specification with detailed technical architecture
**Output:** Implementation-ready specifications with clear decision rationale

#### Multi-Session Investigation (Continuation strategy)
**When:** Requires research, testing, or validation between sessions
**Focus:** Iterative discovery with client feedback between sessions
**Output:** Evolving specifications based on research and client input

## üìã Collaborative Documentation Patterns

### Client Vision Capture
```markdown
## Client Vision & Requirements

### Success Definition
**Client Goal:** [What success looks like from client perspective]
**Key Metrics:** [How client will measure success]
**User Experience Vision:** [Client's philosophy on user experience]

### Constraints & Context
**Timeline:** [Client timeline constraints and priorities]
**Resources:** [Available development resources and constraints]
**Technical Philosophy:** [Client preferences on technical approaches]
**User Reality:** [How users actually behave vs how client wants them to behave]
```

### Expert Analysis Framework
```markdown
## Expert Analysis & Recommendations

### Technical Options Assessment
**Option A:** [Approach] - [Pros/Cons for client's specific situation]
**Option B:** [Approach] - [Pros/Cons for client's specific situation]
**Recommended:** [Best fit for client vision + constraints]

### Implementation Implications
**Development Effort:** [Resource requirements for client's preferred approach]
**Timeline Impact:** [How approach affects client timeline]
**Risk Assessment:** [Technical and business risks specific to client situation]
**Success Factors:** [What needs to be true for client's approach to succeed]
```

### Collaborative Decision Documentation
```markdown
## Strategic Decisions Made

### Approach Selected
**Chosen Strategy:** [What we decided and why]
**Client Rationale:** [Why this fits client vision]
**Expert Rationale:** [Why this is technically sound]
**Tradeoffs Accepted:** [What we're giving up and why that's okay]

### Implementation Strategy
**Development Approach:** [How we'll build this]
**Phase Planning:** [Priority order and timeline]
**Success Criteria:** [How we'll know it's working]
**Iteration Plan:** [How we'll improve based on results]
```

## üîÑ Quality Standards for Collaborative Planning

### Client Vision Alignment
**Understanding Validated:** Client confirms we understand their vision correctly
**Constraints Acknowledged:** Technical approach respects real constraints
**Success Criteria Clear:** Both sides agree on what success looks like
**Philosophy Integrated:** Technical decisions align with client's business philosophy

### Expert Value Delivered
**Options Presented:** Client understands different technical possibilities
**Tradeoffs Explained:** Clear understanding of implications of different approaches
**Best Practices Applied:** Industry knowledge adapted to client's specific situation
**Implementation Feasible:** Technical approach is realistic given constraints

### Collaborative Quality
**Mutual Understanding:** Both client vision and technical reality are respected
**Shared Decision Making:** Decisions made together, not imposed by either side
**Clear Rationale:** Why we chose this approach over alternatives
**Implementation Ready:** Specifications sufficient for confident development

## üöÄ Ready for Collaborative Planning

**Enhanced Methodology:**
- **Client vision discovery** before any technical research or specification
- **Expert knowledge applied** to client's specific situation and constraints
- **Collaborative solution design** combining client needs with technical best practices
- **Adaptive scope** matching session depth to complexity discovered during collaboration

**Quality Framework:**
- **Client understanding validated** before proceeding to technical specification
- **Expert value delivered** through relevant options and tradeoff analysis
- **Shared decision making** resulting in mutually agreed specifications
- **Implementation readiness** with clear rationale for approach selected

**Next Planning Session Protocol:**
1. **Start with client vision** - understand goals, constraints, philosophy first
2. **Apply expert knowledge** - provide relevant options and implications
3. **Collaborate on solution** - work together to design approach
4. **Document rationale** - capture why this approach fits client situation
5. **Validate understanding** - ensure alignment before proceeding to implementation
