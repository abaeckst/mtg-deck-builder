- [ ] **Smart Impact Analysis:** HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW risk features using guide integration points
- [ ] **File Request:** Request specific files identified from guide analysis
- [ ] **Strategic Archive Check:** Reference documentation catalog if facing similar past problems
- [ ] **Session Goal:** [Clear objective with success criteria]
- [ ] **Create Session Log Artifact:** `session_log_YYYY-MM-DD_[description].md` (MANDATORY)
```

## üìã Enhanced Session Type Templates

### Enhancement Development
```markdown
**Goal:** [Enhancement name and description]
**Files (from Code Organization Guide):** [Primary files, integration files, type files]
**Pattern:** [Development pattern from streamlined guide]
**Strategic Archive Reference:** [If applicable - similar methodology from past]
**Implementation:** [1-3 key steps]
**Success Criteria:** [Specific deliverables]
```

### Issue Resolution  
```markdown
**Issue:** [Exact problem and reproduction]
**Files (from Code Organization Guide):** [Bug area files, integration files]
**Performance Check:** [If applicable - apply timing analysis patterns]
**Debugging Plan:** [Systematic approach - step back after 2-3 attempts for additional context]
**Success Criteria:** [Issue resolved + no regressions]
```

### Architecture Work
```markdown
**Goal:** [Refactoring objective from guide roadmap]
**Files:** [Target files from guide health assessment]  
**Methodology Reference:** [Component extraction, performance optimization, unified state patterns]
**Pattern:** [Extraction/improvement methodology]
**Success Criteria:** [Improved architecture + maintained functionality]
```

### Performance Optimization
```markdown
**Goal:** [Performance improvement objective]
**Files:** [Target hooks/components from guide performance patterns]
**Timing Analysis:** [Apply systematic performance debugging methodology]
**Pattern:** [Hook optimization, API efficiency, progressive loading patterns]
**Success Criteria:** [Measurable performance improvement]
```

## üéØ Enhanced Session Execution Protocol

### Pre-Development Checklist:
- **Python Scripts:** State filename FIRST: "Creating update_[component]_[feature].py" (PROJECT SOURCE CODE ONLY)
- **Guide Reference:** Apply streamlined Code Organization Guide patterns
- **Archive Check:** Use documentation catalog for similar past problems
- **Session Log:** Create MANDATORY artifact (never text-only summary)

### During Development:
- **Apply proven patterns** - Use documented integration points and methodologies
- **File size awareness** - If modifying 400+ line files, note size and suggest extraction when relevant
- **Document progress** - Key decisions and pattern usage in session log artifact
- **Validate guide accuracy** - Note any discrepancies for maintenance
- **Step back trigger** - After 2-3 failed attempts, request additional context
- **Performance focus** - Apply timing analysis if performance-related work

### Smart Testing (5 minutes max):
- **HIGH Risk:** Test 1-3 features with complex dependencies (per guide analysis)
- **MEDIUM Risk:** Quick verification of 1-2 simpler integrations  
- **SKIP:** Independent features identified in guide
- **Performance validation** - Verify optimization improvements if applicable
- **Time-box strictly** - Log issues, don't debug during wrap-up

### Python Script Protocol:
- **Filename verification:** "‚úÖ Filename verified: update_[component]_[feature].py"
- **Command match:** Provide exact same filename in command
- **PROJECT SOURCE CODE ONLY:** Components, hooks, utilities - NOT project knowledge documents
- **Large files:** Use update scripts vs full content for 500+ line files
