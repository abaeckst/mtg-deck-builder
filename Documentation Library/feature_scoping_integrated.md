# Feature Scoping Framework - Integrated Methodology

**Systematic Approach to Detailed Feature Specification**  
**Last Updated:** June 10, 2025  
**Integration:** Connects with Strategic Planning Overview and Enhanced Planning Methodology  
**Purpose:** Structured framework for converting feature requirements into implementation-ready specifications

## üéØ Feature Scoping Strategy & Integration

### **Relationship to Overall Planning**
Feature scoping bridges between high-level feature requirements (from research sessions) and detailed technical architecture (planned for Session 4). Each scoping session produces implementation-ready specifications that inform technical decisions.

### **Dependency-Based Sequencing**
Features are scoped in order of dependencies, ensuring that foundational decisions inform dependent feature specifications.

## üìã Feature Scoping Session Catalog
