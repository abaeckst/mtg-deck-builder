## 🔄 Session Log Workflow Documentation

### Session Log Lifecycle (Proven Effective)

**Creation:** Each development session gets new session log with comprehensive detail  
**Naming:** `session_log_YYYY-MM-DD_session[N]_[description].md`  
**Content:** Debugging steps, technical discoveries, integration insights, handoff context  
**Duration:** Temporary - exists during active development work  
**Reconciliation:** User signals when ready for batch documentation updates  

### Reconciliation Process (Successfully Completed)

**Trigger:** User explicitly signals "reconciliation time"  
**Recent Example:** Sessions 1-13 successfully reconciled on June 6, 2025, Sessions 1-3 reconciled on June 7, 2025
**Process:**
1. Review all session logs chronologically to understand progression
2. Create completion documents for finished features
3. Create investigation summaries for completed research
4. Update core project documentation with new capabilities  
5. Archive planning documents that are now obsolete
6. Delete session logs after successful incorporation

**Benefits Proven:**
- **Reduced overhead** during active development sessions
- **Comprehensive context** preserved across multi-session work (16 sessions total)
- **Better debugging continuity** with detailed session history
- **Efficient batch updates** to permanent documentation
- **Clear decision rationale** for complex technical choices
