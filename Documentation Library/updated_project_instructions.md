# MTG Deck Builder - Streamlined Project Instructions

**Status:** Phase 4B+ Complete | **Path:** `C:\Users\carol\mtg-deck-builder` | **GitHub:** https://github.com/abaeckst/mtg-deck-builder

## 🚨 Critical Technical Limitations

**File Updates:**
- Claude cannot modify local files directly
- Provide complete content OR Python scripts for user to run
- Python scripts: Artifact filename must match command filename exactly
- Large files (500+ lines): Create update scripts vs full content

**Required Process:**
1. Choose script filename FIRST: `update_[component]_[feature].py`
2. Use exact same name in artifact title AND command
3. Small files: Provide complete updated content

## 🎯 Enhanced Workflow Protocol

**Foundation:** Code Organization Guide + Session Logs + Smart Testing = Maximum efficiency

### Mandatory Implementation Checklist:

**Session Logs:**
- [ ] **ALWAYS create session log artifacts** (never text-only summaries)
- [ ] Document progress, decisions, and guide validation
- [ ] Include smart testing results and next steps

**Python Scripts:**
- [ ] **State filename FIRST:** "Creating update_search_performance.py"
- [ ] **Create artifact with EXACT filename stated**
- [ ] **Verify match before sending:** "✅ Filename verified: update_search_performance.py"
- [ ] **Provide command with EXACT same filename**

**Development Process:**
- [ ] **Reference Code Organization Guide** for file identification and patterns
- [ ] **Apply proven patterns** (component extraction, performance optimization, unified state)
- [ ] **Smart testing only HIGH risk features** (5min max)
- [ ] **Step back after 2-3 failed attempts** - request additional context

### Essential Steps:
1. **File Identification:** Use Code Organization Guide decision tree for instant location
2. **Pattern Application:** Apply documented integration points and proven methodologies  
3. **Session Documentation:** Create artifact-based session logs during work
4. **Quality Assurance:** Risk-based testing using guide impact analysis

### Debugging Protocol:
- **Performance Issues:** Apply timing analysis → identify bottlenecks → fix re-render loops
- **Integration Problems:** Use systematic debugging methodology from archives
- **After 2-3 attempts:** "I may be missing fundamental context about how [system] works"
- **Destructive changes:** Get explicit permission before removing functionality

## 📚 Documentation Strategy

### Active Project Knowledge (Claude's Memory):
- **Code Organization Guide** - Streamlined file identification and integration patterns
- **Project Status** - Current capabilities and development options
- **Session Templates** - Efficient workflow methodology
- **Documentation Catalog** - Archive retrieval guide

### Strategic Archive System:
- **When Needed:** Similar problems to past solutions, methodology replication, architectural decisions
- **Categories:** Implementation case studies, methodology patterns, technical deep dives, session archives
- **Access Pattern:** Problem-based retrieval using catalog guide

### Workflow:
**Active Development:** Code Org Guide + Session artifacts + Smart testing  
**Strategic Retrieval:** Documentation catalog for proven methodologies and implementation details  
**Reconciliation:** User signals → Update active docs → Archive detailed session materials

## ❌ Critical Anti-Patterns

**Workflow Violations:**
- Session logs as text responses (must be artifacts)
- Python filename mismatches (choose name FIRST)
- Skipping Code Organization Guide reference (efficiency loss)
- Testing everything instead of risk-based approach

**Development Anti-Patterns:**
- Update `project_status.md` during active work (wait for reconciliation)
- Make destructive changes without permission
- Continue debugging >3 attempts without requesting context
- Skip proven pattern application when relevant

## 🔄 Session Flow

**Start:** 
1. State filename if creating Python scripts
2. Code Organization Guide → Impact analysis → File identification
3. Apply relevant proven patterns

**During:** 
1. Create session log artifact documenting progress
2. Apply patterns → Document decisions → Validate guide accuracy
3. Step back if stuck after 2-3 attempts

**End:** 
1. Smart testing (HIGH risk only) → Session log completion
2. Verify Python script filename matches if applicable
3. Wait for reconciliation signal before updating core docs

## 🚀 Ready for Development

**Optimized Setup:**
- **Streamlined Code Organization Guide** - 40% more efficient, maintains full utility
- **Strategic Documentation Catalog** - Archive retrieval for complex problems
- **Enhanced Session Workflow** - Artifact-based logs with proven pattern application
- **Performance Debugging Expertise** - Timing analysis and hook optimization patterns

**Next Session Protocol:**
1. **Reference Code Org Guide** decision tree for instant file identification
2. **Apply proven patterns** when relevant (extraction, performance, unified state, responsive design)
3. **Create session log artifact** during development work
4. **Smart testing** HIGH risk features only (5min max)
5. **Filename verification** for Python scripts (state name FIRST)

**Achievement:** Enhanced workflow efficiency with systematic pattern application and strategic knowledge retrieval  
**Status:** Ready for continued development with optimized productivity and proven methodologies
