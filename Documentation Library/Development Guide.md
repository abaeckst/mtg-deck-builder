# MTG Deck Builder - Enhanced Development Guide

**Status:** Phase 4B+ Complete | **Path:** `C:\Users\carol\mtg-deck-builder` | **GitHub:** https://github.com/abaeckst/mtg-deck-builder  
**Last Updated:** January 14, 2025

## üö® Critical Technical Limitations

**File Updates:**
- Claude cannot modify local files directly
- Provide complete content OR Python scripts for user to run
- **Python scripts ONLY for PROJECT SOURCE CODE** (components, hooks, utilities, CSS)
- **PROJECT KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENTS cannot be modified** - wait for reconciliation signal
- Python scripts: Artifact filename must match command filename exactly
- Large files (500+ lines): Create update scripts vs full content

**Required Process:**
1. Choose script filename FIRST: `update_[component]_[feature].py`
2. Use exact same name in artifact title AND command
3. **Verify file type:** Project source code (scriptable) vs project knowledge (wait for reconciliation)
4. Small files: Provide complete updated content

**File Type Classification:**
- **Project Source Code (Can Script):** All files in `/src/` directory, CSS files, config files
- **Project Knowledge (Cannot Modify):** Documentation files, session templates, project status, code organization guide

## üéØ Enhanced Development Workflow

**Foundation:** Code Organization Guide + Session Logs + Smart Testing + Technical Debt Awareness = Maximum efficiency

### Mandatory Implementation Checklist:

**Session Logs:**
- [ ] **ALWAYS create session log artifacts** (never text-only summaries)
- [ ] Document progress, decisions, guide validation, and technical debt considerations
- [ ] Include smart testing results and next steps

**Python Scripts:**
- [ ] **State filename FIRST:** "Creating update_search_performance.py"
- [ ] **Verify file type:** Confirm target is project source code, not project knowledge
- [ ] **Create artifact with EXACT filename stated**
- [ ] **Verify match before sending:** "‚úÖ Filename verified: update_search_performance.py"
- [ ] **Provide command with EXACT same filename**

**Development Process:**
- [ ] **Reference Code Organization Guide** for file identification and proven patterns (3D components, progressive loading, technical debt awareness)
- [ ] **Apply proven patterns** (component extraction, performance optimization, unified state, progressive loading, 3D integration, CSS coordination)
- [ ] **Smart testing only HIGH risk features** (5min max)
- [ ] **Step back after 2-3 failed attempts** - request additional context

### Essential Steps:
1. **File Identification:** Use Code Organization Guide decision tree for instant location and pattern identification
2. **Pattern Application:** Apply documented integration points, proven methodologies, 3D animation patterns, progressive loading patterns
3. **Session Documentation:** Create artifact-based session logs during work with technical debt awareness
4. **Quality Assurance:** Risk-based testing using guide impact analysis and technical debt considerations

### Debugging Protocol:
- **Performance Issues:** Apply timing analysis ‚Üí identify bottlenecks ‚Üí fix re-render loops ‚Üí progressive loading optimization
- **Integration Problems:** Use systematic debugging methodology including CSS coordination patterns and 3D animation debugging
- **CSS Coordination Issues:** Apply clean separation patterns ‚Üí systematic conflict resolution ‚Üí container stabilization
- **3D Animation Problems:** Hardware acceleration verification ‚Üí positioning context validation ‚Üí event isolation testing
- **Progressive Loading Issues:** Viewport detection analysis ‚Üí loading state verification ‚Üí performance optimization
- **After 2-3 attempts:** "I may be missing fundamental context about how [system] works"

### **Implementation Instance (Claude Code)**
**Responsibilities:**
- Actual file modifications and code writing following specified patterns
- Running tests and validation using our smart testing protocols
- Git operations and version control with systematic checkpointing
- Performance testing and optimization applying our proven approaches
- Incremental development with checkpoints and technical debt awareness

### **Handoff Protocol**
**Implementation Spec Format:**
```markdown
# Feature: [Name]
## Goal: [Clear objective]
## Context: [Relevant System Guide sections + Technical Debt awareness]
## Files: [From Code Org Guide - specific file list]
## Approach: [Proven patterns: extraction/optimization/unified state/progressive loading/3D integration]
## Requirements:
- [Specific technical requirements]
- [Integration points to preserve]
- [Performance criteria]
- [Technical debt considerations]
## Testing: [Smart testing validation approach - HIGH risk features only]
## Patterns: [Reference our methodologies including 3D/progressive loading]
```

### **Quality Assurance Strategy**
**Pre-Implementation:** Claude Code reads relevant System Guide sections, verifies proven patterns, confirms technical debt context
**During Implementation:** Pattern compliance, incremental testing, performance monitoring, rollback strategy
**Post-Implementation:** Smart testing (HIGH risk, 5min max), integration verification, performance validation, documentation notes

## üìö Documentation Strategy

### Active Project Knowledge (Claude's Memory):
- **Enhanced Code Organization Guide** - Streamlined file identification, 3D component patterns, progressive loading patterns, technical debt awareness
- **Project Status** - Current Phase 4B+ capabilities, technical debt resolutions, development options
- **Development Session Templates** - Efficient workflow methodology with mandatory artifact logging
- **Documentation Catalog** - Strategic archive retrieval guide for complex problems and methodology replication

### Strategic Archive System:
- **When Needed:** Similar problems to past solutions, methodology replication, architectural decisions, 3D animation patterns, progressive loading implementation
- **Categories:** Implementation case studies (3D flip, progressive loading, CSS coordination), methodology patterns, technical deep dives, session archives
- **Access Pattern:** Problem-based retrieval using catalog guide for proven pattern replication

### Workflow:
**Active Development:** Code Org Guide (instant identification + technical debt awareness) ‚Üí System Specs (complete context) ‚Üí Session artifacts ‚Üí Smart testing  
**Strategic Retrieval:** Documentation catalog for proven methodologies including 3D animation and progressive loading patterns  
**Complex Problems:** Archive consultation for methodology replication and pattern application  
**Reconciliation:** User signals ‚Üí Update active docs ‚Üí Archive detailed session materials

## ‚ùå Critical Anti-Patterns

**Session Startup Violations (NEVER DO THESE):**
- Starting with analysis tool to "investigate files"
- Writing code without examining current state first
- Making assumptions about what files are needed
- Jumping straight into solutions without understanding current implementation
- Skipping the "What files should I examine?" question
- Ignoring technical debt context when making changes

**Workflow Violations:**
- Session logs as text responses (must be artifacts)
- Python filename mismatches (choose name FIRST, verify source code target)
- Attempting to script project knowledge documents (only source code)
- Skipping Code Organization Guide reference (efficiency loss)
- Testing everything instead of risk-based approach (HIGH priority only)
- Ignoring technical debt priorities when planning changes

**Development Anti-Patterns:**
- Update `project_status.md` during active work (wait for reconciliation)
- Make destructive changes without permission
- Continue debugging >3 attempts without requesting context
- Skip proven pattern application when relevant (extraction, optimization, progressive loading, 3D integration)
- Ignore CSS coordination patterns when working with styling
- Skip progressive loading patterns for new card display features
- Ignore 3D animation architecture when working with card components
