# MTG Deck Builder - Enhanced Development Guide v2

**Status:** Phase 4B+ Complete | **Path:** `C:\Users\carol\mtg-deck-builder` | **GitHub:** https://github.com/abaeckst/mtg-deck-builder  
**Last Updated:** January 14, 2025 | **Enhanced:** System Guide Integration for Claude Code

## 🚨 Critical Technical Limitations

**File Updates:**
- Claude cannot modify local files directly
- Provide complete content OR Python scripts for user to run
- **Python scripts ONLY for PROJECT SOURCE CODE** (components, hooks, utilities, CSS)
- **PROJECT KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENTS cannot be modified** - wait for reconciliation signal
- Python scripts: Artifact filename must match command filename exactly
- Large files (500+ lines): Create update scripts vs full content

**Required Process:**
1. Choose script filename FIRST: `update_[component]_[feature].py`
2. Use exact same name in artifact title AND command
3. **Verify file type:** Project source code (scriptable) vs project knowledge (wait for reconciliation)
4. Small files: Provide complete updated content

**File Type Classification:**
- **Project Source Code (Can Script):** All files in `/src/` directory, CSS files, config files
- **Project Knowledge (Cannot Modify):** Documentation files, session templates, project status, code organization guide

## 🎯 Enhanced Development Workflow with System Guide Integration

**Foundation:** Code Organization Guide + System Guide Usage Protocol + Session Logs + Smart Testing = Maximum efficiency

### System Guide Usage Protocol (Claude Code Essential)

#### **Pre-Implementation System Guide Protocol:**

**1. Guide Selection Matrix:**
```
Feature Type → Primary Guide → Essential Sections
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Search/Filter → Search & Filtering → Technical Architecture + Performance Considerations + Problem Diagnosis
Card Display → Card Display & Loading → Technical Architecture + Critical Data Flows + Performance Considerations  
Layout/State → Layout State → Technical Architecture + Critical Data Flows + Current System Status
Drag/Drop → Drag & Drop → Technical Architecture + Critical Data Flows + Problem Diagnosis
Export → Export & Formatting → Technical Architecture + Performance Considerations + Current System Status
Cross-System → Data Management → Component Hierarchy + Integration Points + Performance Considerations
```

**2. Essential Reading Strategy:**
- **Technical Architecture:** Always read - provides file relationships and integration patterns
- **Critical Data Flows:** Read for complex features - shows how systems coordinate
- **Problem Diagnosis:** Read when debugging - provides systematic troubleshooting
- **Performance Considerations:** Read for optimization work - shows bottlenecks and patterns
- **Current System Status:** Read to understand working vs broken functionality

**3. Pattern Extraction Checklist:**
```markdown
□ File organization patterns (which files work together)
□ Integration point preservation (cross-system coordination)
□ Performance optimization approaches (proven methodologies)
□ State management patterns (unified vs distributed)
□ Debugging methodologies (systematic approaches)
□ Technical debt awareness (current limitations and solutions)
```

#### **During Implementation Guide Application:**

**4. Guide Reference Integration:**
- **Architecture Validation:** Does implementation follow guide's component hierarchy?
- **Integration Preservation:** Are cross-system coordination points maintained?
- **Pattern Application:** Are proven methodologies being applied correctly?
- **Performance Standards:** Does implementation meet guide's performance targets?

**5. Debugging Fallback Protocol:**
```
Issue Type → Guide Section → Specific Methodology
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Performance → Performance Considerations → Timing analysis → bottleneck identification
Integration → Problem Diagnosis → Cross-system coordination debugging
Visual/UI → Problem Diagnosis → Systematic DOM investigation workflow
State Management → Technical Architecture → State flow analysis
API Issues → Critical Data Flows → API integration patterns
```

**6. Implementation Validation:**
- **Cross-reference guide patterns** during implementation
- **Validate integration points** are preserved per guide documentation
- **Apply guide debugging methodologies** when issues arise
- **Confirm performance targets** are met per guide specifications

### Mandatory Implementation Checklist:

**System Guide Integration:**
- [ ] **Read specified guide sections BEFORE starting implementation**
- [ ] **Extract key patterns** relevant to the specific feature
- [ ] **Identify integration points** that must be preserved
- [ ] **Note debugging methodology** to use if issues arise
- [ ] **Validate against guide standards** during implementation

**Session Logs:**
- [ ] **ALWAYS create session log artifacts** (never text-only summaries)
- [ ] **Document system guide usage** and pattern application
- [ ] **Include guide validation** and architectural compliance
- [ ] **Reference specific guide sections** used during implementation

**Python Scripts:**
- [ ] **State filename FIRST:** "Creating update_search_performance.py"
- [ ] **Verify file type:** Confirm target is project source code, not project knowledge
- [ ] **Create artifact with EXACT filename stated**
- [ ] **Verify match before sending:** "✅ Filename verified: update_search_performance.py"
- [ ] **Provide command with EXACT same filename**

**Development Process:**
- [ ] **Reference Code Organization Guide** for file identification and system guide selection
- [ ] **Apply proven patterns** from relevant system guide
- [ ] **Preserve integration points** documented in guide
- [ ] **Smart testing only HIGH risk features** (5min max)
- [ ] **Step back after 2-3 failed attempts** - re-read guide debugging methodology

### Essential Steps:
1. **System Guide Selection:** Use Code Organization Guide to identify which system guide to read
2. **Guide Consumption:** Read essential sections and extract key patterns
3. **Pattern Application:** Apply documented integration points and proven methodologies  
4. **Session Documentation:** Create artifact-based session logs documenting guide usage
5. **Quality Assurance:** Risk-based testing using guide performance standards

### Debugging Protocol with System Guide Integration:
- **Performance Issues:** Reference guide's Performance Considerations → Apply timing analysis → Use guide's optimization patterns
- **Integration Problems:** Reference guide's Problem Diagnosis → Use systematic debugging methodology → Check cross-system coordination
- **After 2-3 attempts:** "I may be missing fundamental context - re-reading [Guide Name] [Section]"
- **Destructive changes:** Get explicit permission before removing functionality

- **Project Status** - Current Phase 4B+ capabilities, technical debt resolutions, development options
- **Development Session Templates** - Efficient workflow methodology with system guide integration
- **Documentation Catalog** - Strategic archive retrieval guide for complex problems and system guide methodologies

### System Guide Strategic Usage:
- **When Needed:** Before any major feature implementation, during debugging complex issues, when working across systems
- **Reading Strategy:** Focus on essential sections (Technical Architecture + relevant specialties)
- **Pattern Application:** Extract proven methodologies and apply to implementation
- **Integration Validation:** Preserve cross-system coordination points documented in guides

### Enhanced Workflow:
**Active Development:** Code Org Guide (system guide selection) → System Guide (essential sections) → Pattern Application → Session artifacts → Smart testing with guide validation  
**Strategic Retrieval:** Documentation catalog for proven methodologies with system guide references  
**Complex Problems:** System guide debugging methodologies + archive consultation for pattern replication  
**Reconciliation:** User signals → Update active docs → Archive detailed session materials with guide compliance documentation

## ❌ Critical Anti-Patterns

**System Guide Violations (NEVER DO THESE):**
- Starting implementation without reading specified system guide sections
- Ignoring integration points documented in system guides
- Skipping guide debugging methodologies when issues arise
- Failing to validate against guide performance standards
- Breaking cross-system coordination patterns documented in guides

**Session Startup Violations (NEVER DO THESE):**
- Starting with analysis tool to "investigate files"
- Writing code without examining current state first
- Making assumptions about what files are needed
- Jumping straight into solutions without understanding current implementation
- Skipping the "What files should I examine?" question
- Ignoring system guide context when making changes

**Workflow Violations:**
- Session logs as text responses (must be artifacts)
- Python filename mismatches (choose name FIRST, verify source code target)
- Attempting to script project knowledge documents (only source code)
- Skipping Code Organization Guide reference (efficiency loss)
- Testing everything instead of risk-based approach (HIGH priority only)
- Ignoring system guide patterns when making changes

**Development Anti-Patterns:**
- Update `project_status.md` during active work (wait for reconciliation)
- Make destructive changes without permission
- Continue debugging >3 attempts without re-reading guide debugging methodology
- Skip proven pattern application from system guides when relevant
- Ignore CSS coordination patterns when working with styling
- Skip progressive loading patterns for new card display features
- Ignore 3D animation architecture when working with card components
