## ðŸ”§ File Update Method Selection

### For Small Files (<500 lines) or Major Rewrites:
- Provide complete updated file content
- Use for new files, complete restructuring, or small targeted files

### For Large Files (500+ lines) with Incremental Changes:
- Create Python script using find-and-replace operations
- Script should include all updates in single execution
- Use exact string matching with sufficient context
- Include clear success/error messages

### When to Ask:
"This file appears to be [X] lines with [incremental/major] changes. Should I use the Python script approach or provide the complete file?"

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Phase Quick Reference

### Phase 4 Session (READY WHEN DESIRED):
```markdown

Files needed first: useCards.ts, MTGOLayout.tsx, card.ts, scryfallApi.ts
Time estimate: 4-6 hours (2-3 sessions)

Next step after success: Phase 5 advanced analysis implementation
```

### Phase 5 Session (AFTER 4):
```markdown
Goal: Advanced analysis tools and card preview system
Requirements: Phase 4 completion (import/export working)
Features: Card preview, mana curve, statistics, format legality
```

### Phase 6 Session (AFTER 5):
```markdown
Goal: Performance optimization and production polish
Requirements: Phase 5 completion (analysis tools working)
Features: Virtual scrolling, offline capability, accessibility, PWA
```

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices Reminders

### Information-First Methodology:
- **ALWAYS** request actual source files before coding
- **NEVER** guess at interfaces or method signatures  
- **VERIFY** integration points before implementation
- **UNDERSTAND** complete data flow and state management

### Implementation Success:
- Follow established project patterns and conventions
- Maintain TypeScript type safety throughout
- Test each change individually and in combination
- Verify no regressions in existing functionality

### Documentation Hygiene:
- Update updated_project_status.md immediately after completion
- Maintain single source of truth for project status
- Keep current documentation clean and accurate
- Archive completed phase documentation appropriately

**Usage Instructions:**
1. **Start each session** by choosing template based on desired enhancement
2. **Follow information-gathering step** - Critical for integration success
3. **Use appropriate file update method** - Script for large files, complete for small/new files
4. **Complete wrap-up steps** before ending any session
5. **Update master status** to reflect actual completion state

**Current Priority:** Phase 4 import/export system when additional features desired beyond current complete application.
