# MTG Deck Builder - Documentation Catalog

**Purpose:** Strategic knowledge retrieval system for high-value archive information  
**Last Updated:** June 9, 2025  
**Repository:** https://github.com/abaeckst/mtg-deck-builder

## üìã Active Project Knowledge (Claude's Memory)

**Essential References:**
- **Project Status** - Current capabilities and development options
- **Code Organization Guide** - Streamlined file identification and integration patterns  
- **Session Templates** - Efficient development workflow
- **This Catalog** - Archive retrieval guide

## üìö Archive Retrieval System

### üéØ When to Use Archives

**Implementation Details (6+ months later):**
- "How did we build the drag & drop system?"
- "What were the technical challenges with screenshot generation?"
- "How did we optimize the search performance?"

**Methodology Replication:**
- "We're facing a similar problem to X, how did we solve it before?"
- "What extraction methodology did we use for large components?"
- "How do we debug complex React integration issues?"

**Architectural Decision Context:**
- "Why did we choose approach Y over Z?"
- "What were the trade-offs in the unified state decision?"
- "How did we handle the CSS architecture technical debt?"

### üîç Retrieval Strategy

**Problem-Based Retrieval:**
```markdown
Facing performance issues ‚Üí Check "Performance Optimization" case study
Large component becoming unwieldy ‚Üí Reference "Component Extraction" methodology  
Complex state coordination needed ‚Üí Review "Unified State Management" patterns
Integration debugging required ‚Üí Apply "Advanced Debugging" methodology
```

**Feature-Based Retrieval:**
```markdown
Adding drag & drop ‚Üí "Drag & Drop System" technical deep dive
Adding export features ‚Üí "Screenshot Generation" implementation case study
Enhancing search ‚Üí "Search Enhancement" and "Performance Optimization" case studies
```

**Architecture-Based Retrieval:**
```markdown
CSS becoming difficult ‚Üí "CSS Architecture Modernization" plan and methodology
Hook growing too large ‚Üí "Hook Extraction" patterns from useCards case study
Need responsive design ‚Üí "UI/UX Enhancement" session archives
```

## üîÑ Archive Maintenance Workflow

**During Development:** Session logs capture detailed context and decisions  
**Reconciliation:** User signals ‚Üí Process session logs ‚Üí Update active docs ‚Üí Archive detailed materials  
**Strategic Retrieval:** When facing similar problems ‚Üí Search methodology patterns ‚Üí Apply proven approaches  

**Archive Addition Criteria:**
- Complex problem that took multiple sessions to solve
- Methodology that could be reapplied to similar problems  
- Technical implementation with non-obvious challenges
- Architectural decision with significant trade-offs

**Archive Removal Criteria:**
- Methodology superseded by better approaches
- Implementation details no longer relevant to current architecture
- Decision context no longer applicable

**Current Status:** Strategic knowledge system with proven retrieval value for complex development challenges  
**Usage:** Reference when facing similar problems to past solutions, not for daily development workflow
