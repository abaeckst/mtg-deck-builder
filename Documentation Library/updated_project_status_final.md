## üö® User Issues Discovered and Prioritized

**Post-completion user testing revealed critical workflow issues requiring immediate attention:**

### **Critical Issues (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)**
1. **Search Pagination Limitation** - Only first 175 results processed, breaking sort accuracy
2. **Multi-Word Search Failure** - Natural language search broken without quotes
3. **Multi-Color Filter Confusion** - Unclear "at most" vs "exactly" behavior

### **High Priority Issues**
4. **Filter Panel Appearance** - Current styling doesn't match MTGO professional standards
5. **Filter Organization** - All filters expanded, overwhelming interface
6. **Missing Subtype Filters** - No creature type, spell type filtering capability
7. **Missing Gold Button** - No easy way to filter multicolor cards

### **Medium Priority Issues**
8. **Card Resolution at Small Sizes** - Poor readability when sizing slider is low
9. **Missing Large Card Preview** - No way to examine card details without global size change
10. **Right-Click Selection** - Context menu doesn't select clicked card first
11. **Drag Experience** - Preview too far from cursor, unwanted zone feedback

### **Low Priority Issues**
12. **Screenshot System Robustness** - Generation system needs reliability improvements
