# Streamlined Session Templates

**Purpose:** Efficient workflow templates for maximum development productivity  
**Philosophy:** Code Organization Guide + Focused execution + Smart testing + Minimal overhead

## üöÄ Universal Session Startup (5 minutes)

```markdown
## Session Setup
- [ ] **Code Organization Guide:** Use decision tree for instant file identification
- [ ] **Smart Impact Analysis:** HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW risk features using guide integration points
- [ ] **File Request:** Request specific files identified from guide analysis
- [ ] **Session Goal:** [Clear objective with success criteria]
- [ ] **Create Session Log:** `session_log_YYYY-MM-DD_[description].md`
```

## üìã Session Type Templates

### Enhancement Development
```markdown
**Goal:** [Enhancement name and description]
**Files (from Code Organization Guide):** [Primary files, integration files, type files]
**Pattern:** [Development pattern from guide]
**Implementation:** [1-3 key steps]
**Success Criteria:** [Specific deliverables]
```

### Issue Resolution  
```markdown
**Issue:** [Exact problem and reproduction]
**Files (from Code Organization Guide):** [Bug area files, integration files]
**Debugging Plan:** [Systematic approach - if stuck after 2-3 attempts, request additional context]
**Success Criteria:** [Issue resolved + no regressions]
```

### Architecture Work
```markdown
**Goal:** [Refactoring objective from guide roadmap]
**Files:** [Target files from guide health assessment]  
**Pattern:** [Extraction/improvement methodology]
**Success Criteria:** [Improved architecture + maintained functionality]
```

## üéØ Session Execution Protocol

### During Development:
- **Apply guide patterns** - Use documented integration points and methods
- **Document progress** - Key decisions and pattern usage in session log
- **Validate guide accuracy** - Note any discrepancies for maintenance
- **Step back trigger** - After 2-3 failed attempts, request additional context

### Smart Testing (5 minutes max):
- **HIGH Risk:** Test 1-3 features with complex dependencies (per guide analysis)
- **MEDIUM Risk:** Quick verification of 1-2 simpler integrations  
- **SKIP:** Independent features identified in guide
- **Time-box strictly** - Log issues, don't debug during wrap-up

## üìù Streamlined Session Log Template

```markdown
# Session Log: [Date] - [Brief Description]

## Goal & Status
**Objective:** [What we set out to accomplish]
**Status:** [Complete/In Progress/Blocked]
**Files Modified:** [List with brief descriptions]

## Code Organization Guide Usage
**Files Identified:** [How guide accelerated development]
**Patterns Applied:** [Which documented patterns used]
**Guide Accuracy:** [Discrepancies found, maintenance needs]

## Key Decisions & Technical Insights
- [Major technical decisions made]
- [Integration patterns discovered/confirmed]
- [Debugging approaches that worked/failed]

## Smart Testing Results
**HIGH Risk Features:** [Results of critical testing]
**Issues Found:** [Any regressions - separate debugging needed]
**Testing Time:** [Should be ‚â§5 minutes]

## Next Steps & Context
**Current Status:** [What's working now]
**Next Action:** [What should happen next]
**Important Context:** [Key info if work continues]
```

## üîÑ Session Completion

```markdown
## End-of-Session Protocol (10 minutes)
- [ ] **Smart Testing:** HIGH risk features only (5min max)
- [ ] **Session Log:** Complete with guide validation and key insights
- [ ] **Git Commit:** `git add . && git commit -m "[descriptive message]"`
- [ ] **Push Changes:** `git push origin main`
- [ ] **No Core Doc Updates** - Wait for reconciliation signal
```

## üéØ Template Selection Guide

**Enhancement:** Adding features or capabilities  
**Resolution:** Fixing bugs or improving UX  
**Architecture:** Following refactoring roadmap  
**Investigation:** Exploring new features or approaches

**Key Principle:** Use Code Organization Guide for acceleration, create focused session logs, apply smart testing for quality assurance.
