# Comprehensive TCG Deckbuilder Feature Research

## Research Objective
Conduct a deep dive analysis of web-based deckbuilder platforms across multiple TCGs to identify comprehensive functionality and feature sets for building a modern, competitive deckbuilder platform from the ground up.

## Target Platforms & Games
**Primary TCGs to Research:**
- Magic: The Gathering (MTG)
- Yu-Gi-Oh
- Pokemon TCG
- Flesh and Blood
- Legends of Runeterra
- Hearthstone
- One Piece Card Game
- Marvel Snap
- Disney Lorcana

**Platform Types:**
- Official game websites/tools
- Third-party deckbuilding websites
- Popular community platforms
- Both free and premium/subscription-based tools

## Source Requirements
- **Platform Mix:** Include both major platforms (MTGGoldfish, EDHRec, Moxfield) and niche/innovative tools
- **Geographic Diversity:** Include international platforms (Japanese, European tools)
- **Recency:** Prioritize platforms launched or updated within the last 2-3 years
- **Authority Sources:** Official game company tools, established community sites, and emerging platforms

## Research Methodology
- **Hands-on Analysis:** Actually explore platform interfaces, don't just rely on feature lists
- **User Perspective:** Consider both casual and competitive user workflows
- **Technical Investigation:** Look for publicly available technical blogs, API documentation, or developer insights
- **Comparative Analysis:** Directly compare how different platforms solve the same problems

## Research Constraints
- **Time-Sensitive:** Focus on currently active platforms (avoid discontinued tools)
- **Accessibility:** Prioritize platforms that are accessible without account creation where possible
- **Language:** English-language platforms or tools with English interfaces
- **Scope Boundary:** Exclude pure collection tracking apps unless they have deckbuilding components
