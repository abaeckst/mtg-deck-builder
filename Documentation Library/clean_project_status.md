**Local Path:** C:\Users\carol\mtg-deck-builder

## üèÜ Current Platform - Phase 4B+ Production-Ready

### Professional MTG Deck Builder
- **Authentic MTGO Interface** - 4-panel layout with unified header controls and professional dark theme
- **Enhanced Drag & Drop** - 3x larger previews with centered feedback and professional polish  
- **Comprehensive Filtering** - Gold button multicolor + 500+ subtype autocomplete + all standard filters
- **Multiple View Modes** - Card, pile, and list views with unified deck/sideboard controls
- **Advanced Search** - Multi-field search across names, oracle text, and type lines
- **Progressive Loading** - 75-card initial + Load More with Smart Card Append (scroll preservation)
- **Export Capabilities** - MTGO-format text and screenshot generation
- **Professional Polish** - Enhanced image quality, responsive design, MTGO styling throughout

### Performance Enhancements (June 9, 2025)
- **Search Performance Optimization** - Fixed useSorting hook re-render loops reducing search time from 2-7+ seconds to <1 second
- **Filter Reactivity** - Clean search coordination ensuring filter changes trigger immediate fresh searches
- **Load More Functionality** - Fixed 422 errors with comprehensive pagination state management
- **Image Loading Optimization** - Progressive/lazy loading with consistent normal-size images eliminating "75 cards loading simultaneously" issue

### Enhanced Architecture  
- **Clean Hook Architecture** - useCards coordinator + 5 extracted focused hooks (580‚Üí250 line reduction)
- **Component Extraction** - MTGOLayout (925‚Üí450 lines) + 3 focused area components
- **Unified State Management** - Single controls for deck/sideboard with automatic migration
- **Responsive Design Systems** - Priority-based control adaptation with professional overflow menus
- **Advanced Debugging Capabilities** - Systematic methodologies for complex integration problems

### Verification
```bash
npm start  # Launches complete working application with all performance optimizations
```
