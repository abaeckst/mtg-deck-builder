## ðŸ”§ File Update Method Selection

### For Small Files (<500 lines) or Major Rewrites:
- Provide complete updated file content
- Use for new files, complete restructuring, or small targeted files

### For Large Files (500+ lines) with Incremental Changes:
- Create Python script using find-and-replace operations
- Script should include all updates in single execution
- Use exact string matching with sufficient context
- Include clear success/error messages

### When to Ask:
"This file appears to be [X] lines with [incremental/major] changes. Should I use the Python script approach or provide the complete file?"

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Phase Quick Reference

### Phase 4A Session (READY FOR IMMEDIATE START):
```markdown
Goal: Search System Overhaul - Fix critical pagination and multi-word search issues
Files needed first: scryfallApi.ts, useCards.ts, SearchAutocomplete.tsx
Time estimate: 6-8 hours (3-4 sessions)
Success: All cards fetchable, natural language search, clear color filter behavior
User Impact: HIGH - Fixes workflow-breaking search limitations
```

### Phase 4B Session (AFTER 4A):
```markdown
Goal: Filter System Redesign - Professional MTGO appearance with enhanced functionality
Requirements: Phase 4A completion (search system working properly)

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices Reminders

### Information-First Methodology:
- **ALWAYS** request actual source files before coding
- **NEVER** guess at interfaces or method signatures  
- **VERIFY** integration points before implementation
- **UNDERSTAND** complete data flow and state management

### Implementation Success:
- Follow established project patterns and conventions
- Maintain TypeScript type safety throughout
- Test each change individually and in combination
- Verify no regressions in existing functionality

### User Issue Resolution Focus:
- Prioritize workflow-breaking issues first (search, filters)
- Test solutions with real user scenarios
- Verify improvements actually enhance user experience
- Document user feedback and iterate based on usage
