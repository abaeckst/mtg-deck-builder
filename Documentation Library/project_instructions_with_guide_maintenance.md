## üîß Code Organization Guide Maintenance Framework

### Core Principle: Maintain Guide Accuracy for Continued Workflow Efficiency

The Code Organization Guide is **critical infrastructure** that must remain accurate to maintain development workflow efficiency. Guide maintenance is treated as seriously as code maintenance.

### Maintenance Triggers - When Guide Updates Are Needed

#### **MAJOR UPDATES (Required - Schedule Separate Session):**
- **New files added** (components, hooks, services) to core architecture
- **Files deleted or significantly refactored** during development
- **Architecture patterns change** (new integration approaches discovered)
- **Large-scale refactoring** affecting multiple files or integration points
- **New development patterns established** that should be documented for future use

#### **MINOR UPDATES (Recommended - During Reconciliation):**
- **Integration points discovered** that weren't documented in guide
- **Risk assessment accuracy issues** found during testing
- **Development patterns refined** through usage
- **File size changes** crossing health thresholds
- **Method signatures or dependency flows changed**

#### **VALIDATION UPDATES (Periodic - Scheduled Review):**
- **Guide accuracy verification** after major development phases
- **Integration point validation** after refactoring sessions
- **Health status review** after multiple development sessions
- **Pattern effectiveness assessment** based on usage experience

### Guide Maintenance Process

#### **During Sessions (Continuous Monitoring):**
```markdown
## Code Organization Guide Validation (Every Session)
- [ ] **Guide Accuracy Check:** Does reality match guide predictions?
- [ ] **Missing Information:** Any undocumented integration points or patterns?
- [ ] **File Health Changes:** Any files crossing size/complexity thresholds?
- [ ] **New Patterns:** Any development approaches that could enhance guide?
- [ ] **Risk Assessment Accuracy:** Did guide predictions match testing needs?
```

#### **During Reconciliation (Assessment & Minor Updates):**
1. **Compile maintenance findings** from all session logs
2. **Categorize update needs:** Major vs Minor vs Validation
3. **Execute minor updates** immediately during reconciliation
4. **Schedule major updates** as separate maintenance sessions
5. **Document guide changes** made during reconciliation

#### **Separate Maintenance Sessions (Major Updates):**
1. **Code Organization Guide Maintenance Session** using Template 5
2. **Current state validation** against actual implementation
3. **Comprehensive guide updates** addressing accumulated needs
4. **Quality assurance** and internal consistency checks
5. **User validation** of significant changes

### Maintenance Decision Framework

#### **Minor Updates (Handle During Reconciliation):**
- Individual integration point corrections
- Single file health status updates
- Small pattern refinements
- Risk assessment accuracy improvements

#### **Major Updates (Require Separate Session):**
- Multiple new files or deleted files
- Significant architecture changes
- New development pattern categories
- Large-scale refactoring impact
- Complete section rewrites

#### **Update Execution Process:**
1. **Session Documentation:** Note all guide-related findings in session logs
2. **Reconciliation Assessment:** User and Claude evaluate update needs together
3. **Update Categorization:** Determine minor vs major update requirements
4. **Minor Updates:** Claude executes immediately during reconciliation
5. **Major Updates:** User signals "update Code Organization Guide" for separate session
6. **Validation:** User reviews and validates significant guide changes
7. **Deployment:** Updated guide replaces current version in project knowledge

## üéØ Smart Regression Testing Philosophy (Enhanced with Guide Validation)

### Core Principle: Intelligent Risk Assessment + Architecture Understanding + Guide Accuracy

- **Focus on what MIGHT actually break** using Code Organization Guide integration analysis
- **Ignore what WON'T break** based on documented component and hook dependencies
- **Leverage architecture understanding** for accurate risk assessment
- **Validate guide accuracy** through testing experience

### Pre-Session Smart Analysis (2-3 minutes) - Code Organization Guide Enhanced with Validation

```markdown
## Smart Impact Analysis (Enhanced with Code Organization Guide + Validation)
**Feature/System being modified:** [Use Code Organization Guide for instant file identification]

**Files identified from Code Organization Guide:**
- Primary files: [Files that will definitely be modified]
- Integration files: [Files with documented dependencies] 
- Type/utility files: [Supporting files that might be affected]

**Guide Accuracy Check:**
- Do file descriptions match current reality?
- Are integration points accurately documented?
- Do health assessments reflect current file state?

**Systems being modified this session:**
- Hooks: [Specific hooks from guide analysis]
- State: [State objects/properties changing]
- Components: [Components being modified]

**Risk Assessment (Guide-Informed with Validation):**
- **HIGH RISK:** [1-3 features with complex dependencies per guide integration analysis]
- **MEDIUM RISK:** [1-2 features with simpler integration per guide]
- **LOW RISK (SKIP):** [Independent features identified in guide we won't test]
```

### Smart Testing Heuristics (Enhanced with Guide Validation)

**HIGH RISK (Always test) - Code Organization Guide Informed:**

- Features using the same hooks you're modifying (per guide hook analysis)
- Features with complex state management identified in guide
- Features that have broken before from similar changes
- Features sharing data objects with your changes (per guide integration points)
- **Validate guide accuracy:** Do testing results match guide risk predictions?

**MEDIUM RISK (Quick verification) - Code Organization Guide Informed:**

- Features using modified components but simpler integration (per guide component analysis)
- Features that might be affected by UI changes (per guide dependency flow)
- Features with some dependency on modified systems (per guide integration matrix)
- **Validate guide accuracy:** Do integration points work as documented?

**LOW RISK (SKIP testing) - Code Organization Guide Informed:**

- Features that are completely independent (per guide architecture analysis)
- Features using different hooks/state entirely (per guide separation analysis)
- Features never affected by similar changes
- Features with no shared dependencies (per guide integration documentation)
- **Validate guide accuracy:** Confirm independence through development experience

### End-of-Session Testing (5 minutes max) - Enhanced Efficiency with Guide Validation

```markdown
## Targeted Regression Verification (Code Organization Guide Enhanced with Validation)
**HIGH RISK (Must test):** [1-3 critical features per guide integration analysis]
**MEDIUM RISK (Quick check):** [1-2 features per guide dependency documentation]
**Time-boxed rule:** If any test takes >2 minutes, note as "needs investigation"
**Issues found:** [Log regressions, don't debug during wrap-up]
**Code Organization Guide Effectiveness:** [How well guide predicted actual risk areas]
**Guide Accuracy Validation:** [Did guide predictions match development reality?]
**Maintenance Needs:** [Any guide updates needed based on testing experience]
```

## üîÑ File Update Workflow with Python Script Consistency (Enhanced with Guide Reference)

### CRITICAL CLARIFICATION: Claude's Capabilities

**Claude CANNOT directly modify local files. Claude can only:**

- ‚úÖ Provide complete file content for user to copy/paste
- ‚úÖ Create Python scripts for USER to run locally
- ‚úÖ Give step-by-step instructions for manual updates
- ‚úÖ **Reference Code Organization Guide for instant file identification and integration understanding**
- ‚úÖ **Validate Code Organization Guide accuracy during development**
- ‚ùå Cannot run scripts or modify files directly

### File Update Method Selection (Code Organization Guide Enhanced with Validation)

**For SMALL files (<500 lines) or MAJOR rewrites:**

- **Reference Code Organization Guide first** to understand file health and size
- **Validate guide health assessment** against current file state
- Provide complete updated file content in artifacts
- User copies content and replaces local file
- Use for new files, complete restructuring, or targeted small files

**For LARGE files (500+ lines) with INCREMENTAL changes:**

- **Check Code Organization Guide health assessment** before choosing approach
- **Validate guide size assessment** against actual file size
- Create Python script using find-and-replace operations
- USER runs script locally in project directory
- Script must follow STRICT FILENAME CONSISTENCY PROTOCOL

**When Uncertain:** "Based on the Code Organization Guide, this appears to involve [large/small] files with [health status]. I'll validate the guide assessment - should I create a Python script for you to run locally, or provide complete updated files?"

### Python Script Filename Consistency Protocol (CRITICAL)

**MANDATORY PROCESS:**

1. **Choose Script Filename FIRST:** Decide on exact filename before creating artifact
2. **Standard Naming Pattern:** update_[component]_[feature].py
3. **Use EXACT Filename:** Same name in artifact title AND command
4. **Verify Consistency:** Double-check filename matches before providing command

## üö® FILENAME PRESERVATION PROTOCOL (CRITICAL)

**NEVER change filenames when providing updated files:**

- ‚úÖ For existing files: Use EXACT original filename in artifact title
- ‚úÖ Update content only - never change filename itself
- ‚úÖ Verify consistency across all internal references
- ‚ùå Never rename files during updates

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture - Established Patterns (Enhanced with Guide Maintenance)

## üí° Smart Testing Examples by Feature Type (Code Organization Guide Enhanced with Validation)

### Modifying Filter System:

- **HIGH RISK:** Sorting (state dependencies per guide), Search (same hooks per guide), Load More (pagination per guide)
- **MEDIUM RISK:** View modes (might be affected by filter state changes per guide dependency analysis)
- **SKIP:** Drag & drop, context menus, panel resizing (independent systems per guide architecture analysis)
- **Guide Validation:** Verify dependency predictions match actual testing results

### Modifying Search System:

- **HIGH RISK:** Filtering (shared state per guide), Load More (pagination per guide), Enhanced search features (same service layer per guide)
- **MEDIUM RISK:** Sort functionality (might use search results per guide integration points)
- **SKIP:** Panel resizing, exports, view modes (different hooks/state per guide separation analysis)
- **Guide Validation:** Confirm integration point accuracy through development experience

### Modifying View Components:

- **HIGH RISK:** Features that render the same cards per guide component analysis, Selection system (per guide hook dependencies)
- **MEDIUM RISK:** Sort/filter display (visual integration per guide)
- **SKIP:** Search, filtering logic, data management features (different concerns per guide architecture)
- **Guide Validation:** Validate component dependency documentation through testing

### Modifying Hook Systems:

- **HIGH RISK:** ALL features that directly use the modified hook per Code Organization Guide hook analysis
- **MEDIUM RISK:** Features that might indirectly use modified hook per guide integration documentation
- **SKIP:** Features using completely different hooks/state per guide dependency analysis
- **Guide Validation:** Verify hook dependency accuracy through regression testing results
