- `ViewModeDropdown.tsx` (~150 lines) - Context-aware dropdown with nuclear z-index handling (2,000,000 in overflow context)

### Integration Points
**MTGOLayout Coordinator:**
- **Hook Systems:** Coordinates useLayout, useSelection, useCards, useDragAndDrop, useContextMenu
- **Callback Patterns:** 30+ callback functions for inter-system communication including drag callbacks, context menu actions, deck management
- **State Coordination:** Unified deck/sideboard controls through layout.viewModes.deckSideboard and layout.cardSizes.deckSideboard
- **Area Component Integration:** Passes coordinated state and callbacks to CollectionArea, DeckArea, SideboardArea

**Enhanced Card Component Hierarchy:**
```
DraggableCard (interaction detection)
└── FlipCard (3D animation wrapper - conditional for double-faced cards)
    └── MagicCard (pure display component)
```

**FlipCard Integration Patterns:**
- **Conditional Rendering:** FlipCard wrapper only applied to double-faced cards (`card_faces.length >= 2`)
- **Transparent Integration:** Single-faced cards bypass FlipCard and render MagicCard directly
- **State Preservation:** Flip state isolated to component level, preserves all existing interactions
- **Event Coordination:** Advanced event isolation with `stopPropagation()` for flip button clicks

**useCards Hook Coordination:**
- **Extracted Hook Management:** Coordinates useSearch, usePagination, useCardSelection, useSearchSuggestions, useFilters
- **Parameter Management:** Clean coordination prevents search accumulation through stable dependencies
- **Filter Reactivity:** Skip-on-mount protection with automatic fresh searches on filter changes
- **Performance Optimization:** Memoized returns and stable hook dependencies

**Unified State Architecture:**
- **Single Source of Truth:** useLayout manages unified deck/sideboard view modes and card sizes
- **Automatic Migration:** Handles conversion from old pixel-based and separate deck/sideboard systems
- **CSS Integration:** Dynamic CSS custom properties (--deck-area-height-percent, --deck-area-height)
- **Responsive Coordination:** Percentage-based layout with viewport height calculations

### Key Implementation Decisions
**Coordinator Pattern:** MTGOLayout serves as primary coordinator rather than distributed coordination to maintain clear data flow  
**Unified State Inheritance:** SideboardArea inherits view mode and card size from useLayout rather than independent controls for consistency  
**Nuclear Z-Index Strategy:** Extreme z-index values (500,000-2,000,000) for dropdown reliability rather than relative z-index management  
**Hook Extraction Success:** useCards extracted from 580→250 lines + 5 focused hooks for maintainability rather than monolithic approach  
**FlipCard Wrapper Pattern:** Conditional 3D animation wrapper for double-faced cards rather than embedding flip logic in MagicCard  
**Container Stabilization:** CSS Grid compatibility through explicit dimensions and clean positioning contexts rather than complex coordinate calculations  
**CSS Class vs Inline Style Coordination:** Systematic approach needed for consistent styling - CSS classes should define intended behavior, inline styles only for dynamic values

## 3D Flip Animation Integration

### Component Architecture Enhancement
**FlipCard Wrapper Responsibilities:**
- **Double-faced card detection** using `isDoubleFacedCard()` utility
- **3D flip state management** with component-local state isolation
- **Professional flip button rendering** with MTGO styling and responsive sizing
- **Hardware-accelerated 3D transforms** with perspective and rotation management
- **Event isolation** preventing flip interactions from interfering with drag/selection systems

**Integration with Existing Systems:**
- **DraggableCard Coordination:** FlipCard receives all props and passes through to MagicCard
- **Selection System:** Flip state preserved through selection changes, no interference with selection logic
- **Drag System:** Advanced event isolation ensures flip button clicks don't trigger drag operations
- **Context Menu:** Right-click functionality preserved through proper event propagation

### CSS Grid Compatibility Solutions
**Container Stabilization Pattern:**
```typescript
const containerStyles: React.CSSProperties = {
  position: 'relative',
  width: '100%',
  height: '100%',
  minWidth: sizeStyles.width,
  minHeight: sizeStyles.height,
  boxSizing: 'border-box',
  isolation: 'isolate',
  contain: 'layout style',
};
```

**Key Technical Solutions:**
- **Explicit Container Dimensions:** Prevents CSS Grid coordinate system conflicts
- **CSS Isolation:** `isolation: isolate` creates clean stacking context for 3D transforms
- **Layout Containment:** `contain: layout style` provides stable positioning reference
- **Box Model Control:** `boxSizing: border-box` ensures predictable dimension calculations

### Advanced Event Handling Patterns
**Multi-System Event Coordination:**
- **Flip Button Isolation:** `stopPropagation()` prevents selection and drag system interference
- **3D Transform Context:** Button positioned outside 3D transform context for reliable positioning
- **Z-Index Management:** Flip button uses z-index: 20, below nuclear dropdown levels (2,000,000)
- **Hover State Coordination:** Professional hover effects using 2D transforms only (no 3D interference)

## User Experience Design

### Core Functionality
**Primary Use Cases:**
1. **Multi-System Coordination:** Users interact with one system (e.g., search) and see coordinated updates across all areas (collection, deck, sideboard)
2. **Unified Control Experience:** Single view mode and card size controls affect both deck and sideboard simultaneously for consistency
3. **Responsive Layout Management:** System adapts to different viewport sizes with intelligent control hiding and overflow menus
4. **Seamless 3D Card Interaction:** Double-faced cards provide intuitive flip functionality without disrupting existing workflows

**Interaction Patterns:**
- **Callback Coordination:** 30+ callbacks ensure smooth communication between drag & drop, context menus, and deck management
- **State Synchronization:** Changes in one area immediately reflect in related areas through unified state management
- **Responsive Adaptation:** Priority-based control hiding with sophisticated overflow menu systems
- **3D Animation Integration:** Flip animations work seamlessly with all existing interactions (drag, selection, context menu)

### Visual Design Standards
**MTGO Authenticity:**
- **Professional Layout:** 4-panel MTGO-style interface with consistent header styling and visual hierarchy
- **Nuclear Z-Index Management:** Extreme z-index values ensure dropdown menus always appear above content

## Advanced Integration Patterns

### FlipCard Conditional Rendering
```typescript
// Conditional wrapper based on card type
{isDoubleFacedCard(card) ? (
  <FlipCard
    card={card}
    size={size}
    scaleFactor={scaleFactor}
    // ... all MagicCard props
  />
) : (
  <MagicCard
    card={card}
    size={size}
    scaleFactor={scaleFactor}
    // ... all props
  />
)}
```

### Container Stabilization Pattern
```typescript
const containerStyles: React.CSSProperties = {
  position: 'relative',
  width: '100%',
  height: '100%',
  minWidth: sizeStyles.width,
  minHeight: sizeStyles.height,
  boxSizing: 'border-box',
  isolation: 'isolate',
  contain: 'layout style',
};
```

### Advanced Event Isolation
```typescript
const handleFlip = useCallback((e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.stopPropagation(); // Prevents drag/selection interference
  
  if (flipPhase !== 'idle' || !isDoubleFaced) return;
  
  // 3D flip animation logic
}, [flipPhase, isDoubleFaced]);
```

### Nuclear Z-Index Management
```typescript
// Context-aware z-index scaling
const getDropdownZIndex = (context: 'normal' | 'overflow') => {
  return context === 'overflow' ? 2000000 : 500000;
};
```
