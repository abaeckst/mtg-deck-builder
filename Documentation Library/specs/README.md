# Feature Specifications

System-level specifications for major MTG Deck Builder systems.

## Priority for Creation:
- **HIGH:** Search & Filtering System, Drag & Drop System
- **MEDIUM:** Layout & State Management, Card Display & Loading System
- **LOW:** Export & Formatting System

## Specifications to Create:
- `search_filtering_system.md` - Multi-field search, performance optimization, filter coordination
- `drag_drop_system.md` - Visual feedback, interaction patterns, 3x preview scaling
- `layout_state_management.md` - Unified state, responsive design, automatic migration
- `card_display_loading.md` - Progressive loading, intersection observer, consistent display
- `export_formatting_system.md` - MTGO format compliance, screenshot generation

## Creation Process:
1. Development session identifies need for system specification
2. Session log captures "spec update recommendations"  
3. User creates specification during reconciliation using Feature Specification Template
4. Spec guides future development consistency and system understanding

## Template:
Use Feature Specification Template from Claude's active project knowledge.
