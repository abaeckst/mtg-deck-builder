# CSS Recovery Report
Generated: 2025-06-12 15:36:28

## Actions Taken
- ✅ Removed broken src/styles directory
- ✅ Removed failed extraction scripts
- ✅ Removed analysis artifacts
- ✅ Removed backup directories from failed attempts
- ✅ Verified original MTGOLayout.css integrity
- ✅ Fixed MTGOLayout.tsx imports if needed

## Current State
- Original MTGOLayout.css: Working
- Component imports: Restored to original
- Application: Ready for testing

## Lessons Learned
- Regex-based CSS extraction is unreliable for complex CSS files
- CSS is not a regular language - proper parsing needed
- Incremental validation prevents complete failures
- Always maintain working fallback during modernization

## Recommended Next Approach
1. Use proper CSS parser (postcss, css-tree, or similar)
2. Extract one component at a time with validation
3. Keep original CSS working as fallback
4. Test each extraction step before proceeding
